# TCDO：A community-based Traditional Chinese Drug Ontology

## Backgroud
Traditional Chinese drugs (TCD) have been widely used in clinical practice in China and many other regions and recognized as an attractive alternative to conventional medicine due to its valuable therapeutic efficacy. With the rapid progress of bioinformatics, growing researches have attempted to identify TCD’s bioactive ingredients and to clarify their mechanisms of action using integrated datasets from different domains. However, the lack of comprehensive well-structured terminologies or ontologies for the description of TCD has hindered the inter-operation of these data source.

## Content
More than 400 popular TCD decoction pieces (TCD-DP) were selected from authoritative textbooks, standards and terminologies, as well as their crudes, Chinese medicinal material (CMM). The TCD-DP entities are categorized in 23 upper level terms by their clinical effects. Their properties like nature, flavor, toxicity and meridian entries are also defined formally by logical relations. CMM’s species is mapped to the NCBITaxon taxonomy ontology, which establishes a link between traditional medicine and modern biomedical science. TCDO contains over 1,500 terms, including terms drawn from existing ontologies and more than 1,000 TCD-specific terms, labeled in both Chinese and English.
